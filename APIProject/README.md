# Bored API Program Summary

This program asks the user to input a type of activity and then queries the Bored API for activity suggestions that fall under that type of activity.  It will build a list of 50 activities and then ask the user how many people they want to involve in the activity and filter the list down based on this criteria.  Duplicate activities are removed and the final list is printed out for the user to see and pick from.

Documentation on how to use the Bored API can be found [here](https://www.boredapi.com/documentation).
